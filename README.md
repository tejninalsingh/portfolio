There were a lot of challanges which I faced during the making of this website. I was confused between the choices of the libraries which were provided to us, but in the end, I decided to go with Font Awesome for icons, AOS or Animation on Scroll for scroll effects and *BOOTSTRAP*.

During the making of this website, I realised that there are a lot of things which people don't understand while writing the javascript for the website. Actually, if you logically understand what is written in that, you will get to know that these are very basic things and everone can learn JavaScript very easily.

This time, while making the website, I decided to go with all the in-lins css for the website rather than external CSS because it makes more sense when we have less components to actually design them according to our needs.
